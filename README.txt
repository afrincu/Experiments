This is a series of mini projects created in order to get familiar with PHP socket programming, 
with gradual complexity, 
from simple client or server side to a server dealing with multiple connections simultaneously 
to a client connecting to an IRC channel.

The list of files in chronological order and increasing complexity is:

basic-chat:

- server.php
- client.php
- server_multi.php

IRC-client

- client_irc.php

shoutcast-recorder-client

- client_radio.php

Not all the exceptions are treated in this code, since this was not the primary purpose.
